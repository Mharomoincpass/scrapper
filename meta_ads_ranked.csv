Unknown Advertiser,"“You want me to help your father pay off his debts and get him out of jail?” The Lycan King stared at me intensely with his red eyes, “and what would I get in return?”  I swallowed the lump in my throat, looking him right in the eyes.  “Well, at your daughter's wedding the other day, we obviously had a connection…” I said in a sultry voice, “I thought maybe I could do some favors for you in return.”   Taking a deep breath, I undid my coat and revealled my lingerie...  Today was supposed to be the day my fated mate and I got engaged. But now I’m watching him kiss another woman. Marrying her could make him the future Alpha because she’s the daughter of Gavin Landry, the most powerful Lycan chairman in the world. A couple of months ago, our Alpha died during a battle, and now all the candidates are competing for that position, including my mate, Ethan. Everyone knows the Lycans control the werewolf population. And Gavin? He could singlehandedly appoint everyone the new Alpha. So, Ethan made his choice. Her, not me. “Get me a whiskey and a martini for the lady,” A deep voice sounded from nearby. “Is it the future bride, or the future groom that’s got you in a mood?” “I’m just not into parties,” I decided to say. “Nor am I,” he murmured. “I’m here out of obligation.” The bartender placed my drink in front of me and I immediately took a sip, sighing in contentment. I waited for it to do its job and finish numbing the pain. Every time Ethan kissed her it destroyed me a little more. How had my life taken such a devastating turn? How could my fated mate do this to me? Did our 2 years together truly mean nothing? Did the mark on my neck mean that little to him? “Thank you for the drink,” I told the man. I took one last sip of my martini and started to get down from the stool, except my blouse snagged on the corner of the counter and just as I heard a tearing sound, I began to fall to the ground. I closed my eyes, bracing myself for the impact, but it never came. Instead, I felt strong arms wrapping around my body, lifting me into the air. I opened my eyes and peeked up at the man who caught me, and my breath hitched. He was so handsome. He held me with ease as if I weighed nothing and I could tell from the feeling of his arms around me that he was muscular. He smiled down at me and a dimple appeared on his right cheek. I wanted to lick that dimple. “Madam, are you falling for me?” He asked teasingly. I stared at him for a heartbeat longer before I squinted my eyes at him, seeing what he did there. “You’re a funny one, aren’t you?” He grinned. Then he looked at my shirt and immediately frowned. “Let me take you to my suite upstairs,” he said, making my heart skip a beat. “What?” I said in barely a whisper. His eyes met mine and I got lost in their beauty for a moment. Goddess, his good looks were sinful. “Your shirt is ripped. I have one you can wear upstairs in my VIP suite,” he explained. I blinked a couple of times and gave a nervous chuckle. “Oh, alright. Thank you,” I managed to sputter. He turned to the bartender. “Charge our drinks to my suite,” he ordered. “Yes, sir.” I allowed the man to carry me out of the room. His arms were so warm that I found myself resting my head against his broad chest, breathing in his minty scent. My wolf was practically purring in my mind. She’d been quiet for most of the evening while she licked the wounds the broken mate bond had caused. But right now, it was as if she had forgotten she was heartbroken. “Take off your shirt,” he instructed once we were in the suite. He had released me and was walking to the closet. “Excuse me?” I squeaked. “So, you can put on a new shirt,” he explained. “Right,” I breathed. I lifted my ripped shirt over my head and threw it onto the bed, leaving me in only my innerwear from the waist up. Once he found a shirt, he turned around to face me, and his entire body froze as his eyes trailed down my body. I was too busy checking him out to notice him staring at me but the longer I stared at him, the more I started to recognize him. Then, realization struck me, and I gasped. “It’s you…” I breathed, taking a step back. His eyes shifted upward and met mine; his brow arched. “You know me?” He asked. “I know of you,” I clarified. The corner of his lips tipped upward as he walked towards me, slowly, as if he were stalking his prey. I could practically hear the sounds of my heartbeat. “And what do you know of me?” “Only what I’ve heard…” I admitted. “And what have you heard?” “You’re Gavin Landry, Lycan Chairman. You’re a heartbreaker. You have a new woman each week and you never sleep with the same woman twice.” He raised his brows. “Is that so?” He asked. “Tell me more about myself.” Heck, he's the father of the bride and Ethan's future father-in-law? I'm confused, I don't know what I should do. But I'm not surprised I didn't recognize him at first. The Lycan family isn't high profile, they're more used to staying behind the scenes than becoming politicians and celebrities like werewolf Alpha. Should I tell him who I am? But that would be foolish at this moment.   He continued to walk towards me, and I continued to walk backward until my back hit the wall. “What more do you want to know?” I asked, my voice coming out breathy. “Everything.” I’m not sure if it was the martini speaking or me, but I decided to be bold. If Ethan can indulge himself in someone new, then so could I. I lifted my gaze to meet his as he neared closer. “Your eyes…” I started to say. “I’ve heard that they were mesmerizing, and I must agree.” “What else?” I swallowed the lump in my throat. “When you smile, you have this adorable dimple on your cheek…” I whispered. He was only inches from me now, staring so intently at me that I thought I would burn up under his scrutiny. He licked his lips, drawing my attention to his mouth. “And your lips…” Before I could finish that sentence, his mouth crashed into mine. His kiss was anything but soft and sweet but filled with hunger and possession. I kissed him with just as much eagerness. His tongue made its way to mine, tasting every inch of me. He lifted me into the air, my body pinned between the wall and him. Instinctively I wrapped my legs around his waist and allowed him to deepen the kiss. His tongue trailed down the nape of my neck and warmth spread across my body as I felt him nibbling my soft flesh. All self-control and common sense left my mind the moment we kissed. All I could think about was Gavin; he consumed my mind, body, and soul entirely. I pulled at his tie, wanting to take it and his shirt off. He helped me undo his tie and then lifted his shirt over his head, tossing it to the ground. I let my fingers explore his body; they roamed over his torso and up his broad shoulders. I moaned into his mouth as his tongue found mine again. “Are you sure you want this?” He asked between kisses. “Yes,” I rasped out. “We are both willing adults, so why not?” We kissed again and just as he was about to take off my innerwear, I received a tearful mindlink from my adoptive mother. “Judy! Please, come home!” She sounded panicked; my mother never panicked. Hearing her voice was like cold water being dumped on my head and I gasped. I let my legs fall from around him and I pressed against his chest. “Stop,” I said breathlessly. “I have to go.” He frowned. “I don’t have much patience; stop joking,” he says, a hint of anger in his tone. “I’m so sorry. But I’m sure you have plenty of other options,” I said and started to run towards the door, but he grabbed my arm, stopping me. I whirl around to face him, my own anger rushing to the surface but before I can say anything, he points to the bed. “Your shirt is ripped, remember?” I looked down at my innerwear with a frown. “Oh…” He sighed, grabbing his shirt and putting it over my head. I inhaled deeply and warmth spread throughout my body; it smelled like him. …… The moment I stepped into the house; I could hear my mother sobbing. “Judy?” My mother sobbed; I could hear that she was in the kitchen and my heart stuttered at the sound of her broken voice. “Your father was taken away by the Gammas tonight.”   Chapter 2 Judy’s POV My heart fell into my stomach. “What?!” I gasped. We lived in a decent-sized house; my adoptive father, being a successful businessman and a Delta of the Redmoon pack, had a lot of money. “He was arrested,” she explained. “He made a bad investment for the company, and he ended up losing all the money. He went completely bankrupt and now he owes the pack so much money. Until he pays it, they put him in jail.” “They can’t just come and take him away like this,” I said, standing to my feet, hardly able to contain my emotions. “Without any warning? That’s not fair!” “They can do whatever they want. The Beta is under the jurisdiction of the Lycans, and it was his decision. Loan sharks are ruthless, and nobody wishes to deal with them. It’s easier to just get rid of the problem and right now… your father is the problem.” Before I could say anything more, my phone started to ring. I reached into my bag and pulled it out. I frowned when I saw the name flash across the screen. “I heard about your father,” Ethan’s voice was soft as he spoke, and my traitorous heart skipped a beat. I hated how my body responded to him still; it was because of this foolish mate bond. Even though he rejected me, and I accepted it, that didn’t mean it severed our bond. It won’t be severed until he marks someone else.“I might have a suggestion though. But I’d like to tell you in person. Come outside.” I quickly left the kitchen and walked out of the house. Ethan was leaning against his car with his arms folded across his chest. Goddess, I hated how good he looked. I had been in love with him for longer than 2 years. He was my friend, my confidant, my fated mate. When he rejected me, it destroyed everything I had dreamt of. I wrapped my arms around my body, desperately trying to hold myself together. “Why are you here?” I asked him after a long and awkward silence. “I wanted to talk to you,” he replied. “Why?” The corner of his lips tipped upwards as he stared at me; I nearly melted under his scrutiny, and I had to shift my gaze to look at the ground. “Because I can help you,” he answered. “Your father’s funding chain is broken, and he now owes a lot of money. I know for a fact that he doesn’t have that kind of money, especially now that his business has gone under. But I do.” I lifted my gaze to meet him; he was serious. “Are you saying you’d pay my father’s debt?” I asked him. He nodded. “Yes,” he answered. “And what would we have to do in return?” I asked, almost afraid to ask. He smirked, which gave me an uneasy feeling in the pit of my stomach. “There is a condition,” he confessed. I waited silently for him to continue, my eyes never leaving his. “After I get married, I want you to drop out of school and become my mistress.” I couldn’t have heard him correctly; I stared at him with my jaw practically on the ground. “Excuse me?” I managed to sputter. “You want me to what??” “Drop out of school and become my mistress. I already have a luxurious home for you to live in. You would never have to want for anything. I’ll pay off your father’s debt and give you more money than you could dream of.” “How… how could you ask me to do such a thing?” I asked in a choked whisper; tears threatened to spill from my eyes, but I kept them away, not wanting him to see my break. He stepped closer to me, and I felt rooted to the ground, unable to move away. My wolf was whimpering about his request; she couldn’t believe our mate could ask such a thing from us. She was gutted and I hated that she was put in this position. “Because we’ve always been so good together, Judy,” he said, reaching out and touching my arm gently. “We will always have this strong connection, even if I mark someone else. You and your family would be set for life… all you have to do is say yes…” He was rubbing his fingers up and down my arms and I felt sick to my stomach. I finally found the strength to step away from him, my body trembling. “No,” I said, meeting his eyes. “I would never become your mistress.” His eyes darkened. “I’m about to become the Alpha, Judy. You must get with the times. Becoming my mistress would only benefit you and plus, don’t you want your father out of jail?” “I will find another way,” I said through my teeth. “If that’s all you came here to say, then I’ve heard enough. You can leave.” He raised his brows as he stared at me. He studied me for a moment longer like he expected me to change his mind at any moment. “You’ll change your mind,” he told me as he stepped away from me and towards his car. “And when you do, I’ll be here. But until then, your father will remain in prison.” “I’ll figure it out,” I said to his retreating back. “We don’t need you, Ethan!” He chuckled as he opened his car door and then he turned back to gaze into my eyes. “In order to get him out of prison, you’ll need at least 5 million dollars. When you realize that there’s no other option, you’ll come to your senses. I’m sure of it.” Without another word, he got into his car. I watched as he drove away, disappearing into the night. It was only when he disappeared that I allowed myself to fall to the ground. Tears streamed down my cheeks before I could stop them. 5 million dollars? How was I going to come up with that kind of money? —————— I had two classes this morning and one later in the afternoon. My first class was warrior training, and my second class was shifting, both of which I excelled at. I was going to college for Gamma training so that once I graduated, I could prove myself to the Gamma force and become a warrior. Then I would easily be able to pay off my father’s debt and save my family. “You look terrible,” my best friend, Nan, pointed out as I sat beside her against the large Oaktree; the very tree we always met up at. “It was a rough night,” I admitted as I took out my textbook to study. “Where did you go last night? When I returned, you were gone. Did you leave early because of the engagement party?” I bit my lower lip as I thought about what to say to her. If I lied, she’d be able to see right through me. I was a terrible liar initially, but Nan could read me like a book. “I ripped my shirt, and someone brought me into his room to change,” I said, feeling my cheeks growing warm at the memory. She raised her brows, and I could barely look at her. “You went to someone’s room?” She asked. “Whose?” I was quiet for a moment, and she grabbed my arm, getting my attention. “Judy, who did you leave with?” She asked, now her voice was filled with alarm. I knew there was no getting out of this conversation. I bit my lip and peeked up at her through my lashes. “Gavin Landry,” I squeaked. Chapter 3 Judy’s POV “Shut up!” She gasped. “Are you serious?? You went to Gavin Landry’s VIP suite? As in THE Gavin Landry?!” I nearly tackled her; she was being so loud! “Keep your voice down!” I scolded, attempting to cover her mouth with my hands but she was too quick and dodged me. “How can I possibly keep it down when my best friend went to Gavin Landry’s hotel room last night and waited until now to tell me!” She exclaimed. Nan was a waitress at the hotel restaurant the engagement party was at last night. The hotel, called Carter Resorts, was in the human territory, and it was owned by Patrick Carter, the Delta of the Silver Crescent pack. Which happened to be Gavin Landry’s pack. I wasn’t surprised to see Gavin there last night, especially considering his daughter was the bride-to-be. I was less surprised to see that he had a VIP suite at the hotel. I sighed. “It all happened so fast, and I had a bit too much to drink,” I admitted. “I forgot when I got home because other stuff happened.” I wrapped my arms around my body and looked up at her concerned eyes. “What else happened?” She asked, her voice dropping to a whisper. I took a deep breath, and I told Nan everything that happened, right up until Ethan came over and asked me to be his mistress in exchange for him paying off my father’s debt. By the time I finished talking, Nan’s jaw had dropped. “The nerve of that scum!” She hissed. “How dare he! He rejected you and now he wants you to be his bit on the side?! He has zero shame.” “I’m not sure what I’m going to do, Nan,” I whispered. “There’s no way I could come up with 5 million dollars to pay off my father’s debt.” We both fell silent as our thoughts consumed us and then her face lit up. I knew that look well and it grew nervous as a smile spread across her face. I knew right away that she had an idea, and I also knew that I wasn’t going to like it. “You said that he gave you his shirt to wear?” She asked. I nodded. She gasped and grabbed my arm. “Isn’t it obvious, Judy? Gavin is into you. That’s the only reason he’d give you his shirt. He wanted his scent on you! He's very picky. In all my time as a waitress, you're the first woman he's ever offered.” I gawked at her. She had officially lost her mind. “Gavin’s not into me,” I said, shaking my head. “He gave me his shirt because mine ripped. There was nothing to it.” “Why would he even care?” Nan asked, folding her arms across her chest. “He’s Gavin Landry and doesn’t need to care about any of this. Besides, you mentioned that he kissed you heatedly. You were ready to go all the way with him, which is huge because you were planning on waiting until after you were married. There had to be some kind of connection last night.” I glanced at my hands. “Or maybe I was just hurting and wanted to get back at Ethan,” I murmured. “Plus, I had a little too much to drink.” “Drunk actions are sober thoughts or something like that,” she said, waving away my words. Then, she smirked. “You could use this to your advantage. Do you still have that lingerie you bought for your wedding night? You should pay Gavin a little visit and make him an offer he can’t refuse.” ___ I knew it was a bad idea the moment she spoke the words, but her words continued to replay in my mind for the remainder of the day and night. When I woke up the next morning, my mind was made up. I went to my closet and grabbed my red lingerie. I had only tried it on once and I felt a little self-conscious wearing it, but I knew the night of my wedding when I finally gave myself over to Ethan fully, it wouldn’t matter what I was wearing. My heart ached at the thought, and I quickly brushed it out of my head before I started to cry again. I dressed in the lingerie, and I grabbed a long trench coat, wrapping it around my body. I left my hair down and I put on a little makeup to make my features pop. For the last day or so, my mother had either been speaking on the phone to lawyers, visiting my father in prison, or in her room. I had barely seen or spoken to her since I told her Ethan wasn’t going to help us. I hated knowing I disappointed her, but hopefully, this would fix all our problems. It was no secret where Gavin’s office was; everybody knew the famous Gavin Landry Corporation. When I walked through the front door, the receptionist was typing on her computer. She barely spared me a look as I approached the desk. “Good morning, I’m here to see Gavin Landry,” I said as politely as I could. The receptionist looked upward at me and blinked a couple of times, looking less than amused. “Do you have an appointment?” “Uh, no, but—” “Look, I don’t have time for this. Countless women come in here and request to speak with Gavin and I’m going to tell you what I tell them. Mr. Landry is incredibly busy, and he doesn’t have time or patience to be dealing with another fan girl,” she said bitterly. “And what gives you the right to turn away those who come to see me?” A deep voice boomed.   Chapter 4 Judy’s POV “Mr. Landry,” the receptionist said, quickly standing to her feet. She suddenly seemed disheveled, and I wanted to smirk with satisfaction, but I kept it held in. “I asked you a question, Laura,” he said, narrowing his eyes at her. “What gives you the right to send away guests? You know the protocol. You are to call my office, and I am the one who decides whether or not I will see them or not. Not you.” She swallowed and glanced at the ground as if staring directly at him physically hurt her. “Come with me.” It took me a second to realize he was speaking to me, but when I saw the receptionist glaring at me and Gavin’s retreating back, I nearly stumbled over my feet to catch up to him. He walked through a luxurious waiting room until we reached a glass elevator. It was very high-tech with a touch screen attached to it. He brought up a keypad and typed in some sequence before pressing the floor number. He stood so close to me that the elevator felt almost cramped, despite it being a wide space. I could smell his incredible minty scent, mixed in with his aftershave and my heart skipped a beat. He didn’t bother looking at me though and I was starting to doubt this plan would work. Maybe he didn’t like me as much as I thought he did. I felt awkward knowing that under this coat was nothing but lingerie. The elevator came to a halt and the doors opened. It was an extremely large space with marble flooring and granite walls. “Where exactly is your office?” I asked, staring around the gorgeous area. He glanced at me; his face kept indifferent. “This is my office.” My eyes grew large at his words. He continued walking until he rounded the corner and sure enough, there was his desk right in front of large windows that overlooked the human city. It was gorgeous and my stomach twisted with nerves. He didn’t bother sitting on his desk chair. Instead, he turned to face me, leaning against his desk and folding his arms across his chest. I swallowed the lump in my throat as I took him in. He wore a white dress shirt with sleeves rolled up halfway, showing off his incredible muscles and his dark dress pants hugged his waist perfectly, showcasing his incredible form. My wolf purred with satisfaction, and I found myself staring at him for way longer than I intended to. He cleared his throat, making me nearly jump out of my skin as my gaze shot upward and met his. He was smirking at me, as if to say, “Caught you.” My cheeks burned from the embarrassment I felt. “So, what did you come here for?” He asked, breaking the tension between us. Oh. Right. The reason I’m here. “I have a problem, and I need your help,” I said in a rush. He raised his right brow. “What kind of problem?” I cleared my throat before continuing. “My father was arrested the other night,” I blurted. “His business went bankrupt, and he owes a lot of money. Roughly 5 million dollars.” He was silent as he stared at me; I realized he was waiting for me to continue. Probably wanted to know how I needed his help. “I was hoping you’d be able to help him and maybe pay the debt for my father so he could get out of prison?” I asked, biting my lip. He was quiet for another moment, processing my request before he ran his hands over his face. “And what would I get in return for helping your family?” He asked. I swallowed the lump in my throat. Confidence: I needed confidence. I held my head up high and looked him right in the eyes. It was known as a challenge to look an Alpha directly in the eyes, even worse so looking a Lycan directly in the eyes. But Gavin wasn’t as angry as I thought he would be, instead, he looked intrigued. “Well,” I began, I dropped my voice low as I stepped closer to him. “At the party the other day, we obviously had a connection…” I felt my cheeks growing hot as I spoke those words. “And I thought maybe…” I took a deep breath and undid my coat, revealing a portion of my lingerie, but not all of it. Not yet at least. His eyes darkened as he gazed over my body, and I nearly melted under his scrutiny. I suddenly had a surge of confidence, and I reached my hand out to touch his arm. “I thought maybe I could do some favors for you in return,” I said in a sultry voice. “I’m a college student and very clean. I haven’t done it before, but I’m on birth control, so you don’t need to worry about anything.” His breathing grew heavy as he straightened his posture, closing the small gap between us. His nearness was intoxicating, and my heart started to race against my chest. His scent enveloped me, and I couldn’t remember the last time I felt this delirious. He reached his hand up and I felt his fingers glide down my cheek, sending a wave of warmth throughout my whole body. We were so close together that I thought I was going to pass out from the heat that consumed me. His eyes were dark like they were the night in the VIP suite. He swallowed hard and I watched his Adam’s apple move slightly. I closed my eyes, preparing for him to kiss me. I could feel his breath on my lips and just as I leaned in close to him, getting ready for his embrace, it never came. Instead, I felt him adjusting my coat, covering my body. My eyes flew open, and I looked at his stern expression. “Do you really think I need to pay a woman for her body?” He asked, breaking the silence. “You said it yourself that I have many options.” My cheeks flushed immediately. “I just thought—” “You thought you could use your body to pay for my help,” he said, interrupting me. “You are still young, Miss Montague. You will regret taking such shortcuts in the future.” How did he know my name? I hadn’t told him. Had he looked into me? My heart skipped a beat at the thought, but his words were slowly crushing me. He didn’t want me. I lowered my gaze, hating how hot my face was getting. I knew he could see just how embarrassed I was. When he spoke next, he softened his voice and spoke with compassion. “Look, I have a daughter,” he told me. “I would never teach her to use her body as a transaction. I want more for her and her future, and I expect better from her.” He reached his hand and caressed the nape of my neck with his fingertips; my breath hitched as I gazed into his eyes. “I expected better from you,” he added; my heart fell into my stomach and disappointment consumed me. He was right. I was better than this. I nodded my head and opened my mouth to speak, but I heard footsteps behind me. I turned to see a couple of security guards standing nearby and I whipped around to look at Gavin with wide eyes. “I’m afraid my time is up, and my patience has run out,” Gavin said, looking at me briefly before glancing at the security guards. “Accompany Miss Montague out of the building, please.” “Yes sir,” they both said. They stood on each side of me, and I stared at Gavin with shock. I didn’t fight or argue with the security guards as they told me to come with them. “Thank you for your time,” I managed to say before I turned and left the office. I wanted to cry because of the shame, but I knew more importantly I needed a new job. …. “I’m so excited we get to work together,” Nan said with a wide smile. “And you look great in that uniform.” I looked down at my uniform. I felt ridiculous in this thing; it was a short skirt and a crop top that showed way too much bosom. I felt like I was on display. Especially at night when this place pretty much turned into a club. These men are wealthy and would tip generously. It was an opportunity I couldn’t pass up when I was struggling for money. “That’s what friends are for,” she said, nudging my arm with hers. She looked behind me and sighed. “Looks like we are getting a group of guys. Good luck,” she said. I sighed and turned to greet the customers but then I froze when I saw who was amongst them. Ethan.   Chapter 5 Judy’s POV “You were right,” I heard one of his friends saying. “She does work here. This is going to be so good.” “Hey, call girl, can we get a table, or are you just going to stare at us?” Call girl? I placed the menus on the table for them and waited for each of them to take a seat. “I’m not a call girl. Please, take your seat.” As I leaned over the table to put the beer in front of each of them, one of them grabbed my rear end. I felt my entire body freeze. “I like this little uniform on you. How about you take it off and see what’s underneath.” My entire body went hot as I stepped back from the table, forcing his hand to drop. “Do not touch me,” I said loudly to each of them. “Oh, come on, Judy. Aren’t you here to satisfy men?” Another of his friends asked. “So come here and satisfy us. Sit on my lap.” I pressed my lips together. “I’m not a call girl,” I told them for the final time. “I’m a waitress.” “You got this job because you’re hot,” one of them chuckled. “The manager didn’t care about your skills. He cared about whether or not you could flirt with the customers and make him a lot of money. I’m willing to give you a good tip if you let me see what’s underneath your uniform and sit on my lap.” I felt my blood going cold from his words. “Come here baby girl,” he said, patting his lap and winking at me. I just stared at him, disbelieving. I looked at Ethan who was watching me, waiting to see what I would do. How could he just let his friends speak to me like this? At one point, he would have never allowed this. He would have punched anyone who looked at me with desire in their eyes. Now, he was acting as if he didn’t care. “I’ll give you 10 thousand dollars if you drink this entire beer,” one of his friends asked. My mouth nearly fell open. “What?” I asked. “You heard me,” he answered. “Drink this whole beer and you’ll get 10 thousand dollars.” “We’ll all give you 10 thousand dollars each if you drink all of our beers,” another one said. I stared at the beer and then at the men. My eyes landed on Ethan once more; he raised his brows, waiting for my answer. Swallowing my pride, I stepped towards the table and grabbed one of the glasses. I really didn’t like beer, but money was money, and I knew Ethan’s friends were rich and could pay that kind of money easily. I needed the cash to get my father out of prison and pay off his debt. I brought the cup to my lips and let the liquid run down my throat. I winced at the bitter taste, but I kept pushing myself until the cup was empty. His friends were cheering and chanting as I drank the contents of the cup. I slammed the cup on the counter and looked at the next guy who slid his beer at me, winking as he did so. I chugged his beer as well. I only got halfway through the third glass when I felt a firm grip around my wrist and I was yanked away. I heard Ethan’s friends booing and telling him he was a party pooper. I had no idea where Ethan was taking me; he was quiet until we reached outside and then he whipped around to glare at me. “Accept my offer and stop this foolishness,” he ordered. “I won’t be your mistress, Ethan,” I told him, narrowing my eyes, my head fuzzy from the beer. “You can forget about that.” “You’d rather act like a little call girl instead?” He asked through his teeth. “You looked ridiculous in there!” “Why do you care? You have your fiancé. This is my private business, and my private business no longer includes you.” “You are still mine, Judy. You will always be mine,” he growled. I wanted to laugh at his ridiculousness, but I also wanted to cry. He was so sweet at one point; I spent more than 2 years loving this man. Now as he stood before me, I realized he was a stranger. “I am not yours,” I told him, glad that my voice came out stronger than I felt. He let out a bitter laugh. “Fine, be a call girl for all I care,” he growled. “Spread your legs for money because that’s all you’re good for—” Before I could stop myself, my hand swung and made contact with his cheek, causing a loud slap. He didn’t flinch but he did grow angrier as he went to grab my throat. He froze though when he looked at my neck and I watched the color draining from his face. “What the heck,” he hissed. He grabbed my chin and yanked my head to the side. “Is that a lovebite?” I realized when getting dressed this morning that the lovebite Gavin left on me the other night was still there. It was fading, but visible. “So, what if it is?” I asked. He released my chin and glared at me, his gaze icy. “Who the heck have you been with?” “That’s not your concern,” I retorted. I turned to walk away, but he gripped my arm, making me whimper in pain as he whipped me around to face him again. “Answer my freaking question, Judy! Who have you been with?!” Through gritted teeth, I answered, “Gavin. Your future father-in-law. Happy now?” He released me and let out a bark of laughter. “Are you kidding me? You don’t have to make up such a ridiculous story,” Ethan said through a fit of laughter. I heard more laughter from nearby and I realized Ethan’s friends were crowding around. “Is she talking about Gavin Landry? He has standards. He would never go for a girl like, Judy.” “Yeah, Judy is a call girl and Gavin is a Lycan chairman. There’s no way,” another friend laughed. “I’m being serious,” I told them, folding my arms across my chest. This time Ethan did grab my throat, and his gaze turned almost deadly. “Stop playing me for a fool and tell me the truth,” he growled. “Gavin would never want someone like you. You are nobody. You don’t fit into his world. ” I couldn’t breathe as his hands tightened around my throat, so I couldn’t respond. “Now, how about you do as I say and move into the house I bought? Once I get married, I’ll see you frequently at night and you can spread your pretty little legs for me only—” There was a loud honk from nearby, making Ethan drop his hold around my neck. I coughed and rubbed my sore neck as he glared at the person interrupting us. I glanced at the black limo and frowned when the door opened. I gasped when I saw Gavin seated in the back, his eyes on me. “Get in,” he ordered. I stared at him, disbelieving. “I won’t ask you again, Judy,” he said through his teeth. I felt Ethan’s shocked eyes on me as I quickly hurried towards the car and got in, closing the door behind me. “Drive,” he instructed the driver. “Yes, sir.” The car started to move; Ethan stood on the curb; his mouth nearly dropped. His friends were equally shocked. Gavin glanced at me, and I felt my cheeks redden. “Using me to make your ex-fiancé jealous, are you?”",https://www.facebook.com/100090352943774/,100090352943774,8 May 2025 - 11 May 2025,3,24

Unknown Advertiser,"Today was supposed to be the day my fated mate and I got engaged. But now I’m watching him kiss another woman. Marrying her could make him the future Alpha because she’s the daughter of Gavin Landry, the most powerful Lycan chairman in the world. A couple of months ago, our Alpha died during a battle, and now all the candidates are competing for that position, including my mate, Ethan. Everyone knows the Lycans control the werewolf population. And Gavin? He could singlehandedly appoint everyone the new Alpha. So, Ethan made his choice. Her, not me. “Get me a whiskey and a martini for the lady,” A deep voice sounded from nearby. “Is it the future bride, or the future groom that’s got you in a mood?” “I’m just not into parties,” I decided to say. “Nor am I,” he murmured. “I’m here out of obligation.” The bartender placed my drink in front of me and I immediately took a sip, sighing in contentment. I waited for it to do its job and finish numbing the pain. Every time Ethan kissed her it destroyed me a little more. How had my life taken such a devastating turn? How could my fated mate do this to me? Did our 2 years together truly mean nothing? Did the mark on my neck mean that little to him? “Thank you for the drink,” I told the man. I took one last sip of my martini and started to get down from the stool, except my blouse snagged on the corner of the counter and just as I heard a tearing sound, I began to fall to the ground. I closed my eyes, bracing myself for the impact, but it never came. Instead, I felt strong arms wrapping around my body, lifting me into the air. I opened my eyes and peeked up at the man who caught me, and my breath hitched. He was so handsome. He held me with ease as if I weighed nothing and I could tell from the feeling of his arms around me that he was muscular. He smiled down at me and a dimple appeared on his right cheek. I wanted to lick that dimple. “Madam, are you falling for me?” He asked teasingly. I stared at him for a heartbeat longer before I squinted my eyes at him, seeing what he did there. “You’re a funny one, aren’t you?” He grinned. Then he looked at my shirt and immediately frowned. “Let me take you to my suite upstairs,” he said, making my heart skip a beat. “What?” I said in barely a whisper. His eyes met mine and I got lost in their beauty for a moment. Goddess, his good looks were sinful. “Your shirt is ripped. I have one you can wear upstairs in my VIP suite,” he explained. I blinked a couple of times and gave a nervous chuckle. “Oh, alright. Thank you,” I managed to sputter. He turned to the bartender. “Charge our drinks to my suite,” he ordered. “Yes, sir.” I allowed the man to carry me out of the room. His arms were so warm that I found myself resting my head against his broad chest, breathing in his minty scent. My wolf was practically purring in my mind. She’d been quiet for most of the evening while she licked the wounds the broken mate bond had caused. But right now, it was as if she had forgotten she was heartbroken. “Take off your shirt,” he instructed once we were in the suite. He had released me and was walking to the closet. “Excuse me?” I squeaked. “So, you can put on a new shirt,” he explained. “Right,” I breathed. I lifted my ripped shirt over my head and threw it onto the bed, leaving me in only my innerwear from the waist up. Once he found a shirt, he turned around to face me, and his entire body froze as his eyes trailed down my body. I was too busy checking him out to notice him staring at me but the longer I stared at him, the more I started to recognize him. Then, realization struck me, and I gasped. “It’s you…” I breathed, taking a step back. His eyes shifted upward and met mine; his brow arched. “You know me?” He asked. “I know of you,” I clarified. The corner of his lips tipped upward as he walked towards me, slowly, as if he were stalking his prey. I could practically hear the sounds of my heartbeat. “And what do you know of me?” “Only what I’ve heard…” I admitted. “And what have you heard?” “You’re Gavin Landry, Lycan Chairman. You’re a heartbreaker. You have a new woman each week and you never sleep with the same woman twice.” He raised his brows. “Is that so?” He asked. “Tell me more about myself.” Heck, he's the father of the bride and Ethan's future father-in-law? I'm confused, I don't know what I should do. But I'm not surprised I didn't recognize him at first. The Lycan family isn't high profile, they're more used to staying behind the scenes than becoming politicians and celebrities like werewolf Alpha. Should I tell him who I am? But that would be foolish at this moment.   He continued to walk towards me, and I continued to walk backward until my back hit the wall. “What more do you want to know?” I asked, my voice coming out breathy. “Everything.” I’m not sure if it was the martini speaking or me, but I decided to be bold. If Ethan can indulge himself in someone new, then so could I. I lifted my gaze to meet his as he neared closer. “Your eyes…” I started to say. “I’ve heard that they were mesmerizing, and I must agree.” “What else?” I swallowed the lump in my throat. “When you smile, you have this adorable dimple on your cheek…” I whispered. He was only inches from me now, staring so intently at me that I thought I would burn up under his scrutiny. He licked his lips, drawing my attention to his mouth. “And your lips…” Before I could finish that sentence, his mouth crashed into mine. His kiss was anything but soft and sweet but filled with hunger and possession. I kissed him with just as much eagerness. His tongue made its way to mine, tasting every inch of me. He lifted me into the air, my body pinned between the wall and him. Instinctively I wrapped my legs around his waist and allowed him to deepen the kiss. His tongue trailed down the nape of my neck and warmth spread across my body as I felt him nibbling my soft flesh. All self-control and common sense left my mind the moment we kissed. All I could think about was Gavin; he consumed my mind, body, and soul entirely. I pulled at his tie, wanting to take it and his shirt off. He helped me undo his tie and then lifted his shirt over his head, tossing it to the ground. I let my fingers explore his body; they roamed over his torso and up his broad shoulders. I moaned into his mouth as his tongue found mine again. “Are you sure you want this?” He asked between kisses. “Yes,” I rasped out. “We are both willing adults, so why not?” We kissed again and just as he was about to take off my innerwear, I received a tearful mindlink from my adoptive mother. “Judy! Please, come home!” She sounded panicked; my mother never panicked. Hearing her voice was like cold water being dumped on my head and I gasped. I let my legs fall from around him and I pressed against his chest. “Stop,” I said breathlessly. “I have to go.” He frowned. “I don’t have much patience; stop joking,” he says, a hint of anger in his tone. “I’m so sorry. But I’m sure you have plenty of other options,” I said and started to run towards the door, but he grabbed my arm, stopping me. I whirl around to face him, my own anger rushing to the surface but before I can say anything, he points to the bed. “Your shirt is ripped, remember?” I looked down at my innerwear with a frown. “Oh…” He sighed, grabbing his shirt and putting it over my head. I inhaled deeply and warmth spread throughout my body; it smelled like him. …… The moment I stepped into the house; I could hear my mother sobbing. “Judy?” My mother sobbed; I could hear that she was in the kitchen and my heart stuttered at the sound of her broken voice. “Your father was taken away by the Gammas tonight.”   Chapter 2 Judy’s POV My heart fell into my stomach. “What?!” I gasped. We lived in a decent-sized house; my adoptive father, being a successful businessman and a Delta of the Redmoon pack, had a lot of money. “He was arrested,” she explained. “He made a bad investment for the company, and he ended up losing all the money. He went completely bankrupt and now he owes the pack so much money. Until he pays it, they put him in jail.” “They can’t just come and take him away like this,” I said, standing to my feet, hardly able to contain my emotions. “Without any warning? That’s not fair!” “They can do whatever they want. The Beta is under the jurisdiction of the Lycans, and it was his decision. Loan sharks are ruthless, and nobody wishes to deal with them. It’s easier to just get rid of the problem and right now… your father is the problem.” Before I could say anything more, my phone started to ring. I reached into my bag and pulled it out. I frowned when I saw the name flash across the screen. “I heard about your father,” Ethan’s voice was soft as he spoke, and my traitorous heart skipped a beat. I hated how my body responded to him still; it was because of this foolish mate bond. Even though he rejected me, and I accepted it, that didn’t mean it severed our bond. It won’t be severed until he marks someone else.“I might have a suggestion though. But I’d like to tell you in person. Come outside.” I quickly left the kitchen and walked out of the house. Ethan was leaning against his car with his arms folded across his chest. Goddess, I hated how good he looked. I had been in love with him for longer than 2 years. He was my friend, my confidant, my fated mate. When he rejected me, it destroyed everything I had dreamt of. I wrapped my arms around my body, desperately trying to hold myself together. “Why are you here?” I asked him after a long and awkward silence. “I wanted to talk to you,” he replied. “Why?” The corner of his lips tipped upwards as he stared at me; I nearly melted under his scrutiny, and I had to shift my gaze to look at the ground. “Because I can help you,” he answered. “Your father’s funding chain is broken, and he now owes a lot of money. I know for a fact that he doesn’t have that kind of money, especially now that his business has gone under. But I do.” I lifted my gaze to meet him; he was serious. “Are you saying you’d pay my father’s debt?” I asked him. He nodded. “Yes,” he answered. “And what would we have to do in return?” I asked, almost afraid to ask. He smirked, which gave me an uneasy feeling in the pit of my stomach. “There is a condition,” he confessed. I waited silently for him to continue, my eyes never leaving his. “After I get married, I want you to drop out of school and become my mistress.” I couldn’t have heard him correctly; I stared at him with my jaw practically on the ground. “Excuse me?” I managed to sputter. “You want me to what??” “Drop out of school and become my mistress. I already have a luxurious home for you to live in. You would never have to want for anything. I’ll pay off your father’s debt and give you more money than you could dream of.” “How… how could you ask me to do such a thing?” I asked in a choked whisper; tears threatened to spill from my eyes, but I kept them away, not wanting him to see my break. He stepped closer to me, and I felt rooted to the ground, unable to move away. My wolf was whimpering about his request; she couldn’t believe our mate could ask such a thing from us. She was gutted and I hated that she was put in this position. “Because we’ve always been so good together, Judy,” he said, reaching out and touching my arm gently. “We will always have this strong connection, even if I mark someone else. You and your family would be set for life… all you have to do is say yes…” He was rubbing his fingers up and down my arms and I felt sick to my stomach. I finally found the strength to step away from him, my body trembling. “No,” I said, meeting his eyes. “I would never become your mistress.” His eyes darkened. “I’m about to become the Alpha, Judy. You must get with the times. Becoming my mistress would only benefit you and plus, don’t you want your father out of jail?” “I will find another way,” I said through my teeth. “If that’s all you came here to say, then I’ve heard enough. You can leave.” He raised his brows as he stared at me. He studied me for a moment longer like he expected me to change his mind at any moment. “You’ll change your mind,” he told me as he stepped away from me and towards his car. “And when you do, I’ll be here. But until then, your father will remain in prison.” “I’ll figure it out,” I said to his retreating back. “We don’t need you, Ethan!” He chuckled as he opened his car door and then he turned back to gaze into my eyes. “In order to get him out of prison, you’ll need at least 5 million dollars. When you realize that there’s no other option, you’ll come to your senses. I’m sure of it.” Without another word, he got into his car. I watched as he drove away, disappearing into the night. It was only when he disappeared that I allowed myself to fall to the ground. Tears streamed down my cheeks before I could stop them. 5 million dollars? How was I going to come up with that kind of money? —————— I had two classes this morning and one later in the afternoon. My first class was warrior training, and my second class was shifting, both of which I excelled at. I was going to college for Gamma training so that once I graduated, I could prove myself to the Gamma force and become a warrior. Then I would easily be able to pay off my father’s debt and save my family. “You look terrible,” my best friend, Nan, pointed out as I sat beside her against the large Oaktree; the very tree we always met up at. “It was a rough night,” I admitted as I took out my textbook to study. “Where did you go last night? When I returned, you were gone. Did you leave early because of the engagement party?” I bit my lower lip as I thought about what to say to her. If I lied, she’d be able to see right through me. I was a terrible liar initially, but Nan could read me like a book. “I ripped my shirt, and someone brought me into his room to change,” I said, feeling my cheeks growing warm at the memory. She raised her brows, and I could barely look at her. “You went to someone’s room?” She asked. “Whose?” I was quiet for a moment, and she grabbed my arm, getting my attention. “Judy, who did you leave with?” She asked, now her voice was filled with alarm. I knew there was no getting out of this conversation. I bit my lip and peeked up at her through my lashes. “Gavin Landry,” I squeaked. Chapter 3 Judy’s POV “Shut up!” She gasped. “Are you serious?? You went to Gavin Landry’s VIP suite? As in THE Gavin Landry?!” I nearly tackled her; she was being so loud! “Keep your voice down!” I scolded, attempting to cover her mouth with my hands but she was too quick and dodged me. “How can I possibly keep it down when my best friend went to Gavin Landry’s hotel room last night and waited until now to tell me!” She exclaimed. Nan was a waitress at the hotel restaurant the engagement party was at last night. The hotel, called Carter Resorts, was in the human territory, and it was owned by Patrick Carter, the Delta of the Silver Crescent pack. Which happened to be Gavin Landry’s pack. I wasn’t surprised to see Gavin there last night, especially considering his daughter was the bride-to-be. I was less surprised to see that he had a VIP suite at the hotel. I sighed. “It all happened so fast, and I had a bit too much to drink,” I admitted. “I forgot when I got home because other stuff happened.” I wrapped my arms around my body and looked up at her concerned eyes. “What else happened?” She asked, her voice dropping to a whisper. I took a deep breath, and I told Nan everything that happened, right up until Ethan came over and asked me to be his mistress in exchange for him paying off my father’s debt. By the time I finished talking, Nan’s jaw had dropped. “The nerve of that scum!” She hissed. “How dare he! He rejected you and now he wants you to be his bit on the side?! He has zero shame.” “I’m not sure what I’m going to do, Nan,” I whispered. “There’s no way I could come up with 5 million dollars to pay off my father’s debt.” We both fell silent as our thoughts consumed us and then her face lit up. I knew that look well and it grew nervous as a smile spread across her face. I knew right away that she had an idea, and I also knew that I wasn’t going to like it. “You said that he gave you his shirt to wear?” She asked. I nodded. She gasped and grabbed my arm. “Isn’t it obvious, Judy? Gavin is into you. That’s the only reason he’d give you his shirt. He wanted his scent on you! He's very picky. In all my time as a waitress, you're the first woman he's ever offered.” I gawked at her. She had officially lost her mind. “Gavin’s not into me,” I said, shaking my head. “He gave me his shirt because mine ripped. There was nothing to it.” “Why would he even care?” Nan asked, folding her arms across her chest. “He’s Gavin Landry and doesn’t need to care about any of this. Besides, you mentioned that he kissed you heatedly. You were ready to go all the way with him, which is huge because you were planning on waiting until after you were married. There had to be some kind of connection last night.” I glanced at my hands. “Or maybe I was just hurting and wanted to get back at Ethan,” I murmured. “Plus, I had a little too much to drink.” “Drunk actions are sober thoughts or something like that,” she said, waving away my words. Then, she smirked. “You could use this to your advantage. Do you still have that lingerie you bought for your wedding night? You should pay Gavin a little visit and make him an offer he can’t refuse.” ___ I knew it was a bad idea the moment she spoke the words, but her words continued to replay in my mind for the remainder of the day and night. When I woke up the next morning, my mind was made up. I went to my closet and grabbed my red lingerie. I had only tried it on once and I felt a little self-conscious wearing it, but I knew the night of my wedding when I finally gave myself over to Ethan fully, it wouldn’t matter what I was wearing. My heart ached at the thought, and I quickly brushed it out of my head before I started to cry again. I dressed in the lingerie, and I grabbed a long trench coat, wrapping it around my body. I left my hair down and I put on a little makeup to make my features pop. For the last day or so, my mother had either been speaking on the phone to lawyers, visiting my father in prison, or in her room. I had barely seen or spoken to her since I told her Ethan wasn’t going to help us. I hated knowing I disappointed her, but hopefully, this would fix all our problems. It was no secret where Gavin’s office was; everybody knew the famous Gavin Landry Corporation. When I walked through the front door, the receptionist was typing on her computer. She barely spared me a look as I approached the desk. “Good morning, I’m here to see Gavin Landry,” I said as politely as I could. The receptionist looked upward at me and blinked a couple of times, looking less than amused. “Do you have an appointment?” “Uh, no, but—” “Look, I don’t have time for this. Countless women come in here and request to speak with Gavin and I’m going to tell you what I tell them. Mr. Landry is incredibly busy, and he doesn’t have time or patience to be dealing with another fan girl,” she said bitterly. “And what gives you the right to turn away those who come to see me?” A deep voice boomed.   Chapter 4 Judy’s POV “Mr. Landry,” the receptionist said, quickly standing to her feet. She suddenly seemed disheveled, and I wanted to smirk with satisfaction, but I kept it held in. “I asked you a question, Laura,” he said, narrowing his eyes at her. “What gives you the right to send away guests? You know the protocol. You are to call my office, and I am the one who decides whether or not I will see them or not. Not you.” She swallowed and glanced at the ground as if staring directly at him physically hurt her. “Come with me.” It took me a second to realize he was speaking to me, but when I saw the receptionist glaring at me and Gavin’s retreating back, I nearly stumbled over my feet to catch up to him. He walked through a luxurious waiting room until we reached a glass elevator. It was very high-tech with a touch screen attached to it. He brought up a keypad and typed in some sequence before pressing the floor number. He stood so close to me that the elevator felt almost cramped, despite it being a wide space. I could smell his incredible minty scent, mixed in with his aftershave and my heart skipped a beat. He didn’t bother looking at me though and I was starting to doubt this plan would work. Maybe he didn’t like me as much as I thought he did. I felt awkward knowing that under this coat was nothing but lingerie. The elevator came to a halt and the doors opened. It was an extremely large space with marble flooring and granite walls. “Where exactly is your office?” I asked, staring around the gorgeous area. He glanced at me; his face kept indifferent. “This is my office.” My eyes grew large at his words. He continued walking until he rounded the corner and sure enough, there was his desk right in front of large windows that overlooked the human city. It was gorgeous and my stomach twisted with nerves. He didn’t bother sitting on his desk chair. Instead, he turned to face me, leaning against his desk and folding his arms across his chest. I swallowed the lump in my throat as I took him in. He wore a white dress shirt with sleeves rolled up halfway, showing off his incredible muscles and his dark dress pants hugged his waist perfectly, showcasing his incredible form. My wolf purred with satisfaction, and I found myself staring at him for way longer than I intended to. He cleared his throat, making me nearly jump out of my skin as my gaze shot upward and met his. He was smirking at me, as if to say, “Caught you.” My cheeks burned from the embarrassment I felt. “So, what did you come here for?” He asked, breaking the tension between us. Oh. Right. The reason I’m here. “I have a problem, and I need your help,” I said in a rush. He raised his right brow. “What kind of problem?” I cleared my throat before continuing. “My father was arrested the other night,” I blurted. “His business went bankrupt, and he owes a lot of money. Roughly 5 million dollars.” He was silent as he stared at me; I realized he was waiting for me to continue. Probably wanted to know how I needed his help. “I was hoping you’d be able to help him and maybe pay the debt for my father so he could get out of prison?” I asked, biting my lip. He was quiet for another moment, processing my request before he ran his hands over his face. “And what would I get in return for helping your family?” He asked. I swallowed the lump in my throat. Confidence: I needed confidence. I held my head up high and looked him right in the eyes. It was known as a challenge to look an Alpha directly in the eyes, even worse so looking a Lycan directly in the eyes. But Gavin wasn’t as angry as I thought he would be, instead, he looked intrigued. “Well,” I began, I dropped my voice low as I stepped closer to him. “At the party the other day, we obviously had a connection…” I felt my cheeks growing hot as I spoke those words. “And I thought maybe…” I took a deep breath and undid my coat, revealing a portion of my lingerie, but not all of it. Not yet at least. His eyes darkened as he gazed over my body, and I nearly melted under his scrutiny. I suddenly had a surge of confidence, and I reached my hand out to touch his arm. “I thought maybe I could do some favors for you in return,” I said in a sultry voice. “I’m a college student and very clean. I haven’t done it before, but I’m on birth control, so you don’t need to worry about anything.” His breathing grew heavy as he straightened his posture, closing the small gap between us. His nearness was intoxicating, and my heart started to race against my chest. His scent enveloped me, and I couldn’t remember the last time I felt this delirious. He reached his hand up and I felt his fingers glide down my cheek, sending a wave of warmth throughout my whole body. We were so close together that I thought I was going to pass out from the heat that consumed me. His eyes were dark like they were the night in the VIP suite. He swallowed hard and I watched his Adam’s apple move slightly. I closed my eyes, preparing for him to kiss me. I could feel his breath on my lips and just as I leaned in close to him, getting ready for his embrace, it never came. Instead, I felt him adjusting my coat, covering my body. My eyes flew open, and I looked at his stern expression. “Do you really think I need to pay a woman for her body?” He asked, breaking the silence. “You said it yourself that I have many options.” My cheeks flushed immediately. “I just thought—” “You thought you could use your body to pay for my help,” he said, interrupting me. “You are still young, Miss Montague. You will regret taking such shortcuts in the future.” How did he know my name? I hadn’t told him. Had he looked into me? My heart skipped a beat at the thought, but his words were slowly crushing me. He didn’t want me. I lowered my gaze, hating how hot my face was getting. I knew he could see just how embarrassed I was. When he spoke next, he softened his voice and spoke with compassion. “Look, I have a daughter,” he told me. “I would never teach her to use her body as a transaction. I want more for her and her future, and I expect better from her.” He reached his hand and caressed the nape of my neck with his fingertips; my breath hitched as I gazed into his eyes. “I expected better from you,” he added; my heart fell into my stomach and disappointment consumed me. He was right. I was better than this. I nodded my head and opened my mouth to speak, but I heard footsteps behind me. I turned to see a couple of security guards standing nearby and I whipped around to look at Gavin with wide eyes. “I’m afraid my time is up, and my patience has run out,” Gavin said, looking at me briefly before glancing at the security guards. “Accompany Miss Montague out of the building, please.” “Yes sir,” they both said. They stood on each side of me, and I stared at Gavin with shock. I didn’t fight or argue with the security guards as they told me to come with them. “Thank you for your time,” I managed to say before I turned and left the office. I wanted to cry because of the shame, but I knew more importantly I needed a new job. …. “I’m so excited we get to work together,” Nan said with a wide smile. “And you look great in that uniform.” I looked down at my uniform. I felt ridiculous in this thing; it was a short skirt and a crop top that showed way too much bosom. I felt like I was on display. Especially at night when this place pretty much turned into a club. These men are wealthy and would tip generously. It was an opportunity I couldn’t pass up when I was struggling for money. “That’s what friends are for,” she said, nudging my arm with hers. She looked behind me and sighed. “Looks like we are getting a group of guys. Good luck,” she said. I sighed and turned to greet the customers but then I froze when I saw who was amongst them. Ethan.   Chapter 5 Judy’s POV “You were right,” I heard one of his friends saying. “She does work here. This is going to be so good.” “Hey, call girl, can we get a table, or are you just going to stare at us?” Call girl? I placed the menus on the table for them and waited for each of them to take a seat. “I’m not a call girl. Please, take your seat.” As I leaned over the table to put the beer in front of each of them, one of them grabbed my rear end. I felt my entire body freeze. “I like this little uniform on you. How about you take it off and see what’s underneath.” My entire body went hot as I stepped back from the table, forcing his hand to drop. “Do not touch me,” I said loudly to each of them. “Oh, come on, Judy. Aren’t you here to satisfy men?” Another of his friends asked. “So come here and satisfy us. Sit on my lap.” I pressed my lips together. “I’m not a call girl,” I told them for the final time. “I’m a waitress.” “You got this job because you’re hot,” one of them chuckled. “The manager didn’t care about your skills. He cared about whether or not you could flirt with the customers and make him a lot of money. I’m willing to give you a good tip if you let me see what’s underneath your uniform and sit on my lap.” I felt my blood going cold from his words. “Come here baby girl,” he said, patting his lap and winking at me. I just stared at him, disbelieving. I looked at Ethan who was watching me, waiting to see what I would do. How could he just let his friends speak to me like this? At one point, he would have never allowed this. He would have punched anyone who looked at me with desire in their eyes. Now, he was acting as if he didn’t care. “I’ll give you 10 thousand dollars if you drink this entire beer,” one of his friends asked. My mouth nearly fell open. “What?” I asked. “You heard me,” he answered. “Drink this whole beer and you’ll get 10 thousand dollars.” “We’ll all give you 10 thousand dollars each if you drink all of our beers,” another one said. I stared at the beer and then at the men. My eyes landed on Ethan once more; he raised his brows, waiting for my answer. Swallowing my pride, I stepped towards the table and grabbed one of the glasses. I really didn’t like beer, but money was money, and I knew Ethan’s friends were rich and could pay that kind of money easily. I needed the cash to get my father out of prison and pay off his debt. I brought the cup to my lips and let the liquid run down my throat. I winced at the bitter taste, but I kept pushing myself until the cup was empty. His friends were cheering and chanting as I drank the contents of the cup. I slammed the cup on the counter and looked at the next guy who slid his beer at me, winking as he did so. I chugged his beer as well. I only got halfway through the third glass when I felt a firm grip around my wrist and I was yanked away. I heard Ethan’s friends booing and telling him he was a party pooper. I had no idea where Ethan was taking me; he was quiet until we reached outside and then he whipped around to glare at me. “Accept my offer and stop this foolishness,” he ordered. “I won’t be your mistress, Ethan,” I told him, narrowing my eyes, my head fuzzy from the beer. “You can forget about that.” “You’d rather act like a little call girl instead?” He asked through his teeth. “You looked ridiculous in there!” “Why do you care? You have your fiancé. This is my private business, and my private business no longer includes you.” “You are still mine, Judy. You will always be mine,” he growled. I wanted to laugh at his ridiculousness, but I also wanted to cry. He was so sweet at one point; I spent more than 2 years loving this man. Now as he stood before me, I realized he was a stranger. “I am not yours,” I told him, glad that my voice came out stronger than I felt. He let out a bitter laugh. “Fine, be a call girl for all I care,” he growled. “Spread your legs for money because that’s all you’re good for—” Before I could stop myself, my hand swung and made contact with his cheek, causing a loud slap. He didn’t flinch but he did grow angrier as he went to grab my throat. He froze though when he looked at my neck and I watched the color draining from his face. “What the heck,” he hissed. He grabbed my chin and yanked my head to the side. “Is that a lovebite?” I realized when getting dressed this morning that the lovebite Gavin left on me the other night was still there. It was fading, but visible. “So, what if it is?” I asked. He released my chin and glared at me, his gaze icy. “Who the heck have you been with?” “That’s not your concern,” I retorted. I turned to walk away, but he gripped my arm, making me whimper in pain as he whipped me around to face him again. “Answer my freaking question, Judy! Who have you been with?!” Through gritted teeth, I answered, “Gavin. Your future father-in-law. Happy now?” He released me and let out a bark of laughter. “Are you kidding me? You don’t have to make up such a ridiculous story,” Ethan said through a fit of laughter. I heard more laughter from nearby and I realized Ethan’s friends were crowding around. “Is she talking about Gavin Landry? He has standards. He would never go for a girl like, Judy.” “Yeah, Judy is a call girl and Gavin is a Lycan chairman. There’s no way,” another friend laughed. “I’m being serious,” I told them, folding my arms across my chest. This time Ethan did grab my throat, and his gaze turned almost deadly. “Stop playing me for a fool and tell me the truth,” he growled. “Gavin would never want someone like you. You are nobody. You don’t fit into his world. ” I couldn’t breathe as his hands tightened around my throat, so I couldn’t respond. “Now, how about you do as I say and move into the house I bought? Once I get married, I’ll see you frequently at night and you can spread your pretty little legs for me only—” There was a loud honk from nearby, making Ethan drop his hold around my neck. I coughed and rubbed my sore neck as he glared at the person interrupting us. I glanced at the black limo and frowned when the door opened. I gasped when I saw Gavin seated in the back, his eyes on me. “Get in,” he ordered. I stared at him, disbelieving. “I won’t ask you again, Judy,” he said through his teeth. I felt Ethan’s shocked eyes on me as I quickly hurried towards the car and got in, closing the door behind me. “Drive,” he instructed the driver. “Yes, sir.” The car started to move; Ethan stood on the curb; his mouth nearly dropped. His friends were equally shocked. Gavin glanced at me, and I felt my cheeks redden. “Using me to make your ex-fiancé jealous, are you?”",https://www.facebook.com/61555427913037/,61555427913037,3 Apr 2025 - 4 Apr 2025 · Total active time 12 hrs,1.5,68

Unknown Advertiser,"“Good Morning ladies!” The dorm senior, Jenna, shouts as she makes her way down the corridor of the dorms, banging on each door as she goes. I roll over with a gro-an and stretch to pick up my phone. I read the time and then rub my eyes before checking the time again because there’s no way I read it right. Glancing around the room I feel confident that my eyes are now working correctly and check the time again. “Mother fluffer!” I curse under my breath. I was right the first time. It’s 5:30 AM! That confirms my suspicions that perfect Jenna with the too-friendly smile is evil. It’s the first day of university and classes start at 9 AM. Why on earth is she waking the whole dorm up at 5:30? I can hear grumbling and cursing from the other girls through the paper-thin walls as Jenna loudly announces that it’s shower time. I grab the pillow and press it over my head to try and block out the noise. I had my alarm set for 8 AM, which would have given me plenty of time to shower and have breakfast before our first class. I manage to block out enough of the noise that I start drifting back to sleep. BANG, BANG, BANG! “Josie Banks, room number 5, I don’t hear any movement in there!” Jenna’s sickly sweet voice calls through the door as she hammers on it, then she begins to rattle the door handle. With a huff I chuck my pillow on the floor, throw back my covers and get up, stomping to the door I yank it open. “It is 5:30 AM!” I hiss at Jenna. She smiles with fake sympathy as she looks me up and down. “I am aware of the time Miss Banks, but this year’s stock is going to need extra time to get ready if we are going to make any of you look presentable,” she grins. “We are not cattle,” I huff and begin to shut the door in her face. She stops it with a foot in the doorway and looks down at her clipboard. “Josie Banks, eighteen years old, here to study criminology. Father is deceased, mother suffers from psychosis and currently resides in a secure hospital. Josie needs support to process her emotions and would benefit greatly from structure and routine. Josie has no other living rel…” I cut her off by robing the clipboard from her hand and reading the information sheet she had on me. With every word I read of my personal information, my anger grows, like each letter adds fuel to the already growing fire within me. Who gave her this information? She’s just a senior student with a voluntary role as dorm leader, she has no right or need for this information. This is a breach of privacy. “How did you get this?” I seeth. Students gather in the corridor, their attention now focused on the drama unfolding in front of them. “As the dorm leader, I am privy to any information that may help me to support you,” Jenna states, holding her head high like she feels superior. “It was in the enrolment statement, that you signed and agreed to when you accepted your place within this university,” she adds. I tear the page from the clip holding it down and slam the board into her heart. “You had no right to that information, and you certainly had no right to broadcast it to the whole dorm,” I shout as I shove her away from my door. There’s a brief look of shock on her face as her head cracks against the wall before her expression goes blank and she slumps down to the floor with a thud. There's a distinct crack in the plaster on the wall where she hit it. Gasps sound out down the hall as I slam the door. I lean against it in disbelief, looking down at my hands in disgust. “Someone call an ambulance!” I hear one of the girls in the hall shout. How did that just happen? I didn't shove her that hard did I?… no, it's not possible, I'm not that strong and I barely touched her. She must have tripped on something and hit her head. That crack in the wall must have already been there and I'd just not noticed it until now. “Is she breathing?” I hear a panicked voice ask. I don't hear the answer as my ears begin to ring and my heart begins to pound loudly. I feel as if the oxygen has been svcked out of the room as I draw in gasping lungfuls of useless air. My heart tightens with every breath like more and more weight is being added on top of me. My vision goes blurry before turning completely black, then I become light, and the weight lifts from me as I relax into peaceful darkness. “Miss Banks wake up!” a stern voice penetrates the blissful bubble of silence I had fallen into. I blink open my eyes, letting my blurry vision adjust to take in the figure hovering above me. It's a plump lady with a grim-faced expression that I don't recognise. “Who are you?” I murmur, pushing myself up into a sitting position and looking around to take in my surroundings. “ I'm Officer Shelby, I'm with the Mount University Police. We need to take you down to the station,” she gives me a sympathetic smile as she pulls me up to my feet. In the broken doorway of my room stands another police officer. This one is looking curiously between me, the doorway and the crack in the wall where Jenna had been slumped. I svck in a breath as I remember what had happened. Jenna is no longer there, which is good. I must have passed out for a short time and she had reported me to the police for causing her to fall. “I'm sorry officer, this was all a bit of a misunderstanding. I didn't mean for her to fall, I just pushed her out of my doorway so I could close my door and…” I begin to explain until the officer holds up a hand to stop me. “Save it for the interview honey,” she says softly, whilst guiding me out of the building and into the back of a waiting police car. My fellow students watch on, giving looks of pity, smirks and utter disgust as I pass… perfect, I've made a great first impression.  Chapter 2 For the next few hours, I watch the clock in the small room they have me locked in. I’d drank my small paper cup of water hours ago and I've counted every tiny crack I can find in the plastered walls at least ten times. Just when I'm at the point of driving myself completely insane by mentally replaying what happened with Jenna over and over again, the door opens. The male officer that I'd seen in my dorm room earlier walks in and takes the seat opposite me at the table. “Sorry to keep you waiting Miss Banks,” he says, laying a paper folder out on the table. He opens it and begins to read through it in silence. The seconds tick by and I start to get fidgety in my seat at the uncomfortable silence. Just as I open my mouth to break the silence the door opens again and a tall man wearing an expensive-looking suit walks in holding a briefcase. The man looks down at me in an assessing way. He is extremely good-looking and exudes dominance in a way that makes him hard to look at. “Is this her?” he says in an almost snort, jer-king his chin in my direction. “Yes, Sir,” the police officer nods, motioning for the newcomer to sit next to him. He takes his seat and reads through the paperwork the officer hands to him. I study his face as he reads. He's one of those ageless guys. His serious, no-bulllshit demeanour makes him seem like he's much older, but his face is young. My guess is he could be anywhere between twenty and forty. He must feel me looking at him as his eyes flick up to mine over the paper and he holds my gaze. Everything in me screams at me to look away, to break the eye contact, but I don't. I won't be bullied by some stuck-up detective. His eyes grow intense and then I swear I see the flash of a smirk before he slams his hand down on the table, making me jump back in fright. “Are you trying to challenge me Miss Banks?” he asks in a deeper voice than he'd used with the other officer. “Challenge you?” I snort and raise an eyebrow, trying to use my attitude to mask how much he had scared me. “I suggest you learn to submit, and quickly, because at the place you are going, the people won't be as tolerant as I am,” he says, closing the folder and putting it into his briefcase before turning to the officer and nodding. My heart pounds in my heart and panic grips me as I watch the two men shake hands. “I’ll take her from here,” the stuck-up detective tells the officer. “No,” I manage to rasp out. “Please, I didn't mean to hurt her. I can't go to prison. I can't!… Don't I get a solicitor?… A phone call?” I plead with the officer as he leaves the room. I turn my attention back to the suited man. “Please sir, it was an accident,” I sob. “Not so tough now are we?” he smirks at me. “Let's go, Miss Banks, I have a very busy schedule and don't have time for your tears,” he sighs and heads towards the door. I remain seated, frozen in fear and shock. “You have two seconds to follow me, otherwise I will leave you here and let the police throw you in prison,” he snaps. “Wait, what?” I gasp and turn to look at him. He gestures to the open doorway he is standing in and without too much thought I scramble to my feet and rush to his side. “That's what I thought,” I hear him remark under his breath. He walks down the corridor with large strides that I struggle to keep up with. “Where are we going?” I whisper to him as we pass police officers who don't seem to pay any attention to us. He ignores me like the rude assh-ole that he is and doesn't even look at me until we reach the elevator. He presses the button and turns to face me whilst we wait for the doors to open. “Tell me, Miss Banks, are you prone to panic attacks?” He asks “Huh?” I respond, a little taken aback at this whole situation. “Your file says you passed out from a suspected panic attack at the scene, and you seem to be on the brink of another panic attack now. So what I am asking, little girl, is if I’m going to have to hold your hand through our journey?” He snarks. Anger flares in me at his words. “Well I’m sorry Mr Perfect, I’ve had a day so do excuse me if I’m a little upset!” I hiss at him, crossing my arms to let him know how much of a badass I am. He gives me another of his barely there smirks and a nod in what seems like approval. The elevator dings at that moment, the doors opening and he steps forward without another word. I follow the smarmy guy in and stand beside him. I watch as the doors close, with a strange sense that they're closing on my old life. “Collins,” he says, snapping me out of my strange thoughts I turn to give him a questioning look. “It's Mr Collins,” he says in a barely there whisper as he steps dangerously close and looks down at me. So close that when I take a breath my heart touches his. The air suddenly feels charged as I stare up into Mr Collins’ eyes. The arm holding the briefcase snakes around my back and he pulls me flush against his heart, causing me to gasp. Holy sh-it balls this man is hot. He brings up his other hand and gently strokes my cheek with a secret smile, then in a flash he grips my chin hard. “Sleep,” he demands, his eyes flashing blue as he speaks. My last thought before my body shuts down is that I'm going to knee this jer-k in the balls as soon as I get the opportunity.  Chapter 3 “Wake up, Miss Banks,” a smooth voice says, the tone washes over me like a loving caress, and for the first time in a very long time I feel safe and it's not something I want to wake up from just yet. I nuzzle my face into the warmth against my cheek. A sweet, buttery and woodsy kind of scent hits my nose and I give an approving hum at the pleasing smell. A grunt of disapproval ruins my contentment right before I am dropped unceremoniously onto my back. The landing is soft but still unpleasant. “What the he-ll!” I curse, rushing to sit and take in my surroundings. I'm on a couch in a dimly lit room, bright light suddenly floods the room making me squint against it. I shift my attention to the source of the light, fighting the urge to hiss at it like a feral vampire. A large figure is framed by the beaming sunlight that is flooding the room through a window that spans the entire wall. The figure is fussing with the curtains that he's just opened and I quickly recognise him as the stuck-up detective, Mr Collins. The events of the day come rushing back to me like a tidal wave of anger, fear and complete confusion. “What did you do to me? How did we get here?” I demand, gesturing to the room and jumping to my feet. “I don't have time to baby you through this, so here is the quick version,” he starts as he unbuttons his suit jacket and hangs it over the back of a large leather office chair. “My name is Deacon Collins, I am the headmaster of Grey’s Academy and you are the newest student here. Tell me, what do you know about your heritage?” he asks. My eyes are transfixed on his hands as he unbuttons the cuffs of his shirt and rolls up each sleeve to expose some impressive forearms. A throat clearing snaps me out of my trance. “Oh… um,” I start, embarrassed at being caught staring. “Sorry, I'm a little lost here. I'm not feeling myself,” I say with a sigh and flop down onto the couch. I try to process what the he-ll is going on. “Due to your circumstances, I am going to assume you know nothing. Here at Greys Academy, our students are gifted…” he begins. “Wait, gifted?” I interrupt, “I think there's been a mistake. I'm not gifted, I got a pass in all my exams but nothing that makes me stand out,” “If you'd let me finish Miss Banks…” “Josie,” I correct, not liking the way he uses ‘Miss Banks’ in an inferior way. “Miss Banks,” he reiterates, “If you would just keep quiet for two minutes and let me explain then you can be on your way. Our Academy is for what we call Greys. Greys are a race of superhumans. Whilst we are much more powerful than regular humans, we are also small in number. For this reason, we have created our own realm within the human one. This is safer for everyone to live in peace. Somehow, you have slipped through the net and grown up within the human realm. I will be launching a full investigation into how that came to pass, but for now, you are here and you are safe. Now I appreciate this is a lot for you to take in and you have a lot of catching up to do so I won't overwhelm you today. I will have my assistant assign you a dorm room and pair you with one of our more intellectual students to do extra studies with you outside of your regular lessons. I will also schedule some extra studies with our tutors here. Any questions?” he says without a flicker of a smile. “Oh, you are good,” I laugh. “I love this show! I used to watch it all the time,” I say between bouts of laughter. I get up and start exploring the room to find the hidden cameras. I can't believe I'm on the prank show. I wonder who nominated me, it must have been Freya, my best friend from college. “Was it Freya that put you up to this?” I giggle. “Miss Banks!” the actor playing Mr Collins shouts, slamming his hand down on the desk, which just makes me laugh harder. I approach him and examine the buttons on his shirt, one must be a hidden camera. Then I start rubbing my hands over his shirt, feeling for the hidden wires. In a flash his hands wrap around my wrists, making me gasp in shock as he grips them hard, stopping my exploration. I look up at him and his eyes are intense as they stare back at me. “What the he-ll are you doing?” he asks in an almost growl. “Looking for your mic?” I gulp. “I don't have a mic, this is not a prank. You are new here and you've had a lot to take in so this once I will give you a pass, but if you lay your hands on me ever again there will be punishment. Do you understand?” he says in a low, scary tone. His heavy breathing makes me bite my tongue because I really want to taunt him about what this punishment might be. As if he knows what I'm thinking his eyes seem to flash blue. That's when I remember them doing that earlier, right before he demanded that I sleep, a demand I was powerless to resist. Panic bubbles inside me at the realisation. He's telling the truth, isn't he? “You made me go to sleep,” I say with a shaky breath. He gives me a single nod in response. “What else can you make me do?” I ask. Fear at how vulnerable I am right now pushes me to ask the question. “Anything,” he says in a husky whisper, and I swear his face moves closer to mine. His answer doesn't scare me like it should, if anything it excites me. Then a door opens, breaking the trance he has me in, he drops my wrists and takes a step back as if I'm suddenly repulsive to him. I turn to see who the intruder is.  Chapter 4 “I thought I heard voices in here. Is everything okay Dee?” a very attractive woman who looks to be in her thirties says as she walks into the room with a beaming smile. Her hair is jet black and shines as the sunlight hits it. It's the sort of hair that should be in shampoo ads and just enhances her stunning blue eyes and flawless skin. She wears a skin-tight black dress that shows off her hourglass figure and black stilettos, with her finger and toenails painted bright red. She is the kind of woman that makes you feel insecure as soon as you see her. “Yes. Clarrisa, this is Josie Banks, a new student I've just picked up from the human realm. Could you please assign her one of the single dorm rooms in Ruby,” Mr Collins says, whilst he takes out the file from his briefcase that the police officer had given him earlier and holds it out to Clarrisa. “Are you sure? There's plenty of space for her in Amber or Saphire,” Clarrisa says, giving me an assessing look up and down before scrunching her nose a little. “Put her in Ruby please and make sure she has everything she needs,” he says dismissively. Then he sits at his desk and opens up a laptop. I stand there unsure of what I’m supposed to do now. Mr Collins glances up at Clarrisa and then me. “That will be all,” he grunts. “Of course Deacon, Josie follow me please,” Clarrisa smiles tightly. “But…” I start. “That will be all Miss Banks, Clarrisa will get you everything you need and someone will be along to your dorm shortly to answer all your questions and get you settled. Welcome to Greys Academy. I hope there will be no need for any more visits to my office,” Mr Collins says flatly and then turns his attention back to his laptop. With a sigh, I follow perfect Clarrisa. We exit the office into a glass-lined corridor, Clarrisas heels click loudly on the cream marble floor. Everything feels too bright and shiny. I'd hate to be the cleaner here, there must be a whole army of cleaners to keep all the glass and marble clean. Clarrisa leads me to an elevator and I let an audible breath as I remember my last elevator ride before I was kidnapped by a hot, rude of a… wizard? Then I snort laugh as I think about what is happening. I'm in freaking Hogwarts, and that makes Mr Collins Professor Dumbledore. Clarrisa gives me a disapproving side-eye. “Sorry, it's been a wild day,” I explain. “I can imagine. Don't worry about Deacon, he was taking his morning shower when the call came in about you, he had to rush off without his morning coffee, he's grumpy without his coffee,” she laughs, a little too much for it to be real. My mind is suddenly filled with thoughts of Mr Collins in the shower, then I realise what she said. If she was there when he got the call, that means she was there when he was showering. She's his girlfriend… or wife. Of course, she is, she is beautiful and he is hot as he-ll, they are a perfect match. That explains why he jumped away from me like I was on fire, he didn't want his girlfriend to get the wrong idea. My heart sinks a little. I thought I'd felt some chemistry in our short encounter, but I guess it was a wro thought anyway. I'm his student now, and I don't know how things work here but I'm sure it's the same as it is in the human world. Students and teachers dating is a huge no. Why am I wasting time thinking about this when my life has just been completely obliterated? “Wait!” I blurt. “I need to go back… my mum,” I manage to say through panicked breaths. How could I forget about my mum? Guilt floods me. “Don't worry about any of that for now, time works differently here so no one will be missing you yet. Deacon will take care of everything, your mum will be just fine. I'm sure he will keep you updated on personal matters like that,” she smiles. “Okay,” I nod. “What about my stuff? Can I go back for it?” I ask. “Deacon will arrange for your belongings to get to you, try not to worry and just focus on making your new life here. I know this is a difficult time but I'm sure you will be happy here, we will work everything out to make this transition as easy as possible for you,” she says as we walk through a maze of glass and marble corridors. We exit the building into a courtyard with a huge fountain in the middle. The water comes out through four spouts. Above each spout is a large crystal. Clarrisa stops walking for a moment to let me look at it. “Each crystal represents a house at our Academy. You have been assigned to Ruby for the time being,” she motions to the red stone. “You can easily identify your fellow house students by the colour of their tie. Red for Ruby, green for Emerald, blue for Sapphire and yellow for Amber,” she explains as we walk on. I mentally roll my eyes at the thought of wearing a uniform again. I'm almost 19 years old and I feel like I'm going back to secondary school. “Where are the other students?” I ask, taking note of how quiet it is. “They are all in classes, they'll be finishing soon. We have just over 300 students here, it can get quite busy between classes,” she grimaces. Movement in the distance catches my eye and I can just make out a group of about thirty people. They're moving fast around each other as if dancing. As we get closer I realise they're fighting. “Combat training,” Clarrisa comments, “they're our next squad of soldiers,” she adds proudly. I want to get a closer look but Clarrisa ushers me on and towards an old-looking stone building that's embellished with Rubies. “This is your building,” she says as we go through the door. I look around in awe. It's stunning. It's like an old castle inside but with everything you'd expect in a modern house. The large space has stone walls with thick red curtains around the huge windows. Then there are couches scattered around a large rug with a stone fireplace and real fire. There is a big flatscreen TV mounted to one of the walls with game consoles on the shelves underneath it. On each side of the room is a grand staircase that meets at the top. I follow Clarrisa up the stairs and down a hall, we pass two doors before she stops and hands me a key. “This one is yours, I'll give you some time to settle in and someone will be along shortly to show you around,” she smiles and walks away before I can even mutter a thank-you or get the door open.  Chapter 5 I stand in the doorway of my new room open-mouthed. This must be a mistake. This is nothing you'd expect of a dorm. This is more like a hotel suite. The bed is huge, king-size at least, and the pillows are like plush clouds that I just want to jump into. There is a dressing table with a mirror and a walk-in wardrobe that's almost as big as my entire dorm room at Mount University. The large window is framed by bookshelves, stacked with books of every genre you could wish for, and there's a cosy window seat with cushions and a blanket. I almost squeal in excitement. There's a small countertop with tea and coffee-making facilities and a mini fridge. In the bathroom, there's not only a shower but a full-size bathtub. The whole place is a luxury that I've only ever seen on TV and I have no idea how I am going to pay for it because I don't think a part-time job around my studies is going to cut it. I catch a glimpse of myself in the bathroom mirror and cringe. My hair is a mess, and I'm wearing a sleep shirt with shorts and my tatty Converse shoes that Officer Shelby had allowed me to put on before taking me to the station. I look completely out of place here. On the back of the bathroom door, I notice a bathrobe and there's a stack of towels and toiletries in the bathroom cupboard. It's not ideal but I could shower and change into the robe for the time being. I hope my belongings are brought to me soon because I'm going to be the laughingstock of the school if I have nothing but a bathrobe and sleepwear in my wardrobe. After a hot shower, I feel a million times better. I wrap myself in the luxury robe and head over to the bookshelves to check out the selection. Jumping into someone else’s crazy world sounds like a great distraction whilst I wait for someone to bring my things and introduce me to my new life. A book titled ‘Greys’ catches my eye and whilst it's not the fiction I was hoping for it looks like a good place to start learning about my new life. I climb into the window nook and start reading. I learned that Greys are a superhuman race that possess powers that include but are not limited to; super strength, manifestation, teleportation, shapeshifting, superior speed, compulsion, telepathy and telekinesis. I blow out a breath and close the book, already feeling overwhelmed and not sure if I can believe all this. Voices outside my window catch my attention and I lean closer to look down at the ground outside. There's a group of men heading towards my building, they push and shove each other playfully and as they get closer I notice how dirty and dishevelled they look. Maybe they were a part of the group that was combat training earlier. The men file into the door beneath my room and out of sight, except for one. From this angle, I can't see much of his features but he looks tall with a mess of blonde hair that's long on the top but shaved on the sides. He seems puzzled as he turns around and scans his surroundings, maybe he's looking for someone. I glance in the direction he's looking to see if I can see anyone he might be waiting for but there's no one else in sight. I look back at the man and gasp, jumping back from the window when I see him staring straight at me. I swear his eyes flashed blue like Mr Collins had right before he'd used his powers on me. Once I've composed myself I slowly edge back to the window, peeking over the sill to see if he's still there. I blow out a breath when I find the courtyard empty once again. A knock at my door makes me jump once again. Why am I so jumpy all of a sudden? Actually, that's a dumb question. I've literally been dragged from my life and dumped into a whole new realm, where the people have powers and can command me to do whatever they like. I need to keep my guard up and my wits about me if I'm going to survive in this place. I open the door expecting to see Mr Collins, Clarrisa or someone delivering my belongings, but the face that greets me is none of those. It's the blonde man I'd seen through my window. “Well hello there new girl,” he grins at me with the most perfect white teeth. “Hi,” I respond awkwardly, gripping the front of my robe to make sure I'm not flashing anything I don't want him to see. I hear footsteps coming down the corridor and the blonde man rushes into my room and closes the door behind him, almost knocking me over in the process. “What the he-ll?” I demand, trying not to show any fear. “Shh,” he says quietly, putting a finger to his mouth. I'm about to start shouting at him to get out when I hear voices on the other side of the door. When the voices seem to pass by the blonde chuckles. “Sorry, I wanted to talk to you before the rest of the guys find out you're here, I’m Theo Henry, your new neighbour,” he explains and holds out a hand to shake. I bite nervously on my lower mouth debating if I should trust this guy. “I don't bite,” he assures, obviously noticing my hesitation. I look into his eyes and see kindness there. Something deep inside me tells me I can trust him, that he's going to be an important part of my new life here. “I'm Josie,” I finally say, taking his outstretched hand and shaking it. His eyes flash blue and his eyes go wide as a jolt of fear flows through me right before everything goes black.  Chapter 6 My vision returns as fast as it left. Theo is on the floor at my feet sounding. “What was that?” I demand, stepping back from Theo and clutching my hand. “The spark,” Theo gro-ans out, and then he starts laughing. “What does…” I start, but I'm cut off by my door shattering into pieces. Making me shriek and jump back further. A very angry-looking man stands in my doorway, breathing heavily. He takes in the scene in front of him. Dark hair hangs over his eyes but it doesn't hide the fury peeking out behind the dark locks. His hand shoots out towards me and his fingers strain as if he is gripping something, then my oxygen is cut off. I scratch at my neck, trying to remove whatever is wrapped around it that's stopping me from breathing but there's nothing there. “Mason stop, I'm fine,” Theo croaks out and pushes himself to his feet before knocking the dark-haired man's arm down. Precious air fills my lungs and I collapse to my knees in relief. “Josie, are you okay?” Theo asks, knee-ling in front of me. “Get… out!” I rasp between deep breaths. “Let me get you checked over by a nurse,” Theo says softly, reaching out and touching my neck. His touch feels soothing but also hurts my tender skin. I smack his hand away. “You heard the lady, get out Theo, and take that psycho with you!” a female voice calls. I look up to see a short, pixie-looking girl standing near my door, her hands are on her hips and she looks pissed. “He didn't mean it, he thought she was hurting me,” Theo explains. “She was hurting you!” Mason shouts. “No, it was amazing. It was The Spark,” Theo exclaims excitedly. Pixie girl laughs in disbelief and Mason looks like someone just kil-led his kitten. His eyes land on me again and I swear I see murder there. “Sure thing lover boy, everyone knows that's a myth. Go take your boyfriend and daydream elsewhere,” she dismisses. “And fix this door!” she adds coming to stand by my side. “What’s The Spark?” I croak out. “Forget about that for now, we are starting you with the basics, not myths,” she smiles, holding out her hand for me. I take it and let her pull me to my feet. “I’m Dorothy, but everyone calls me Dot. Mr Collins asked me to be your guide, tutor and bestie,” she announces with a salute. “Okay, you caught me, I lied about the besties part but we are going to be besties, I just feel it,” she almost squeals. I'm a little taken aback by her chirpy attitude and how fast she speaks, especially after just being attacked by the Damon Salvatore wannabe. I look over to my door and Theo and his murderous friend are nowhere to be seen, my door is also restored to its former glory, you'd never guess it had been shattered into a million pieces just moments before. “My door,” I gasp. “Mason fixed it, he's a grumpy, possessive guy but he's also fiercely protective and he's great to have around when things get broken, granted it's usually him breaking them, but nobody is perfect,” she says with a shrug. “If I ask you something, will you be honest with me because I'm about ready to lose it,” I ask as I begin pacing my room. “Shoo-t,” she chirps, flopping back onto my bed and examining her bright pink nails. “Is this a mental hospital? Because my mum has psychosis so maybe it's hereditary. After everything that's happened today I'm starting to think I've actually gone insane and all this is a hallucination and I'm a patient here, not a student,” I blurt out. “Nah, it's a school for Greys. Unless I'm hallucinating too… What if everyone here is having the same hallucination and we all think we are at school but really it's a hospital? And Mr Collins is our hot doctor trying to make us all sane again. That would be hilarious,” she says laughing hysterically. I stare at her wide-eyed until she composes herself. “Is that possible?” I ask. Almost afraid of what her answer will be. “Nah. But I do like the idea of Mr Collins being a doctor, I'm going to call him that from now on. Now get dressed, or we will miss dinner, and you don't want to see what happens when I miss dinner,” she smiles sweetly. “I don't have any clothes,” I say with a grimace. Dot gives me a knowing smile and snaps her fingers. “Tah-dah,” she grins, and motions to my wardrobe. With a frown, I open the doors and look in awe at the now fully stocked rails. “How did you do this?” I ask in astonishment. “Fine, you caught me in a lie again. It wasn't me. Mr Collins told me he had stocked your wardrobe. Girl, you must have made a good impression on him. I've never seen him be so kind,” she says coming to stand beside me and bumping her hi-p against mine. “Kind?” I snort. “He was anything but kind,” he must have brought this in whilst I was showering. Thank god I didn't walk out without the robe whilst he was here. “Mmmhmm,” she mocks and pushes past me. She grabs a pair of very short black shorts, a black vest top and a red oversized hoody with Greys Academy embellished on the front. Then she opens a drawer and picks out some underwear before throwing it all at me. “Get dressed, let's go” she makes a shooing motion at me. I take the clothes into the bathroom and dress quickly. Everything fits perfectly and I wonder how Mr Collins knew my size, especially my underwear. I push the thought of him choosing underwear for me from my mind, not wanting that embarrassment to add to the shitstorm of a day. When I leave the bathroom Dot is holding out a brand-new pair of crisp white Converse, I shove my feet into them and follow Dot out the door, ready to explore my new world.  Chapter 7 We head out of our building and across the courtyard to a more modern brick building where students seem to be filtering from all directions. People stare at me and I see them turning to whisper to each other. “Hey beautiful,” a deep voice says from behind us and I turn just in time to see Dot swept off of her feet by a tall man with a mess of shoulder-length blonde hair. Before she has a chance to respond, another male approaches. This one is shorter and has a military-style shaved head. He wraps his arms around her, pulling her from the blond man and planting a kiss on her lips. I stare open-mouthed at the scene in front of me, waiting for a fight to start or for Dot to protest, but it doesn't happen. “Put me down,” Dot giggles and squirms in the man's arms until he releases her. She straightens her clothes and looks back at me. “Josie, this is Marcus,” she points to the blonde, “and this is Cole,” she pats the arm of the second man. “Nice to meet you,” I smile awkwardly at Marcus before turning my attention to do the same to Cole. “Where’s Joe and Max?” Dot asks the men who are now walking beside us. “They came early to get us a table at the front,” Cole answers. “Oh goody,” Dot claps her hands together in delight. “Tables at the front are first in line for seconds, “ she leans closer and whispers to me as we go into a large dining hall. I feel the eyes of all the students all lock onto me and my steps falter at the gravity of the situation I'm in. I feel like a fish that's been dumped into the shark tank as I recount the words in the book I’d read. These are all Greys, superhumans with powers that could do whatever they like to me and I'd be helpless to stop them. How am I going to survive here? “Don't worry, they're just curious. It's not often we get new students, especially at our age. Most people here have grown up together,” Dot reassures, linking her arm in mine and guiding me to a large table. The room is not as impressive as I'd imagined. I was expecting Hogwarts and instead, this is a standard college dining hall. “So this is your new pet?” a handsome black man with shocking blue eyes asks as he stands from the table and pulls Dot into his arms before kissing the top of her head. “Yes, this is Josie. Josie, this is Joe,” Dot introduces. Joe flashes me a 1000-megawatt smile and holds out his hand to shake. I hesitate, remembering what had happened with Theo. “Hi,” I do a small awkward wave instead and quickly avert my gaze. “Babe, I got you a milkshake,” a cheeky-looking dark-haired man interrupts, handing Dot a bottle of strawberry milkshake. “You know how to treat a girl,” Dot gushes, reaching up on her tiptoes to kiss his cheek, before turning back to me, “this is Maximus,” she grins at me. “Max,” he corrects with an eye roll followed by a wink. “I’m Josie,” I smile. “And what did you get me, Max?” Cole asks, elbowing Max in the ribs playfully. All four men begin teasing each other and making jokes. “Sorry, they can be a bit much, but I love them,” Dot says wistfully as she watches the men scuffle. “Let's get some food,” she adds, leading me towards a large food counter. She hands me a tray and a plate and takes one for herself before she starts loading food onto it. The food is laid out under hot counters in a self-serve-style buffet. I take a slice of cheese pizza and some fries as we move along the counter. “So which one are you dating?” I ask, glancing over to the four men who are now seated at the table. “All of them,” she grins at me. “What?” I gasp. “How did you pull that off?” I add with a giggle. I take an apple and a bottle of juice and follow Dot back to the table. “It is how we do things here, take a good look around you,” she laughs. I take a seat beside her and the men get up to get their food. Looking around at the other students I notice distinct groups of one female with up to five men at each table. “Our population is small and females are rare, so mate bonds are formed. It is usually four men to every woman, but sometimes it's three or five men,” she explains. “And the men don't get jealous or fight?” I ask, finding all this hard to believe. “Sometimes at first, but they work it out. Our bonds are not ours to choose. There are a couple of our kind that have the gift of sight, they can detect soulmates and match them together. When a female turns 18 the soul-seer guides her to her bonds,” “And does anyone get a choice in all this?” I struggle to keep the distaste from my voice. This feels dirty and like exploitation. “Of course they do, some resist the bonds, but they almost always give in eventually. It's not easy to ignore your soulmate,” she shrugs. I scan the room again. Everyone looks happy in their groups. Then my eyes land on a table at the back. There are only males at that table, and every single one of them is staring right at me. “Who are they?” I whisper to Dot. “Those are the unbonded, declared to have no living soulmate within the realm and resigned to a solitary life. You've just given them all a second chance,” she says excitedly. My heart skips a beat when my eyes lock with Mason’s, dread fills me when I see the devil in his eyes as he stares back at me with that murderous look once again.",https://www.facebook.com/61555427913037/,61555427913037,7 Apr 2025 - 8 Apr 2025 · Total active time 10 hrs,1.4166666666666667,70
Unknown Advertiser,"The divorce papers were printed half an hour ago. Before that, I was sitting on the couch in the living room all night.  The dozen dishes I carefully prepared remained untouched on the dining table. The Ultraman-themed cake had melted beyond recognition.  Yesterday was my son Anthony’s birthday.  My husband, Mark Lennon, told me to prepare everything, and that he would bring Anthony back for his birthday.  However, I waited for hours at home, only to be disappointed by Sophie's post of the perfect family of four.  How ridiculous.  Mark did not expect me to ask for a divorce. He frowned and tore up the agreement.   ""Lily, what's all the fuss about? We only went to meet Sophie and forgot to tell you about it, didn't we?""  After saying that, his gaze fell on the food on the dining table, and a hint of guilt flashed in his eyes.  His tone softened, ""Fine, I forgot to call you last night. It was my fault. I will fix that. I'll clean up the table. You go and take a nap. I'll take you and Anthony out for a meal at noon.""  He had always been like this, slapping me hard in the face and then rewarding me with sweet gestures after.  Even if he knew that he had gone too far, he would never apologize but only grace me with a way out.   If I didn't act accordingly, he would fight back until I give up and comply.  In the past, I would give in, but this time, I just took out another set of divorce agreements and threw it on the coffee table, ""I printed dozens of copies, you can tear them up again.""  Mark was so furious that he shattered a bowl into pieces.   He impatiently stared at me and said, ""Aren't you just jealous that Anthony likes Sophie more? Lily, don't you forget, you owe her! Anthony and I are taking care of Sophie and her daughter to atone for your sins!""  Atone for my sins? What sin?  Sophie and I were best friends. During the summer break of our junior year, she asked me to hang out.  I was about to head home in the evening. I wanted to take the main road, but she insisted on taking a smaller road and said that a friend was waiting for her at the intersection.  So we parted ways.  The next morning when I woke up, Mark rushed to my house and grabbed my collar.  He asked me why I didn’t call the police and why I didn't care about Sophie.  I was confused at first, but later found out that Sophie had been assaulted by some gangsters after we parted ways.  Sophie claimed that she got caught by them because she wanted to protect me from the gangsters.  She was lying.   I tried my best to defend myself, but no one believed me. The surveillance system was faulty too, so I was left with all the blame.  Since then, I have been seen as a sinner in everyone's eyes.  My parents reprimanded me for being ruthless, and Mark blamed me for being cold-blooded.  All their love for me was given to Sophie in the name of making amends.  They even took my child away, saying that I had no morals and was unworthy of raising him.  Because of this, Anthony and I's relationship hung on a thread. No matter what, I loved him dearly, and I tried hard to amend our relationship.  The two of us looked at each other.  His eyes were cold and full of disdain, as if I was his enemy, ""You ruined my father's and Aunt Sophie's lives. Without you, Aunt Sophie would have been my mother.""  I shuddered with a frown, ""Who told you so?""  Anthony frowned, ""Isn't it?""  I looked at Mark, expecting an explanation.  However, he just avoided my gaze, ""Anthony expressed that if that incident never happened, I would have married Sophie instead.""  In the past, I would demand an explanation. He was my childhood sweetheart, I was the one that introduced them to each other. I was his girlfriend first.   Now… I could not care anymore.  No matter what Anthony asked of me, I decided that I would have nothing to do with him from now on.  I picked up my suitcase and walked out the door, ""Have a good read, I shall see you at the attorney's.""  Chapter 2  Mark didn't expect my luggage to be already packed, so he rushed over to stop me.  At this moment, the sound of the door unlocking came from outside.  The next moment, Sophie walked in holding her daughter Tammy. I did not expect her fingerprint to be keyed into our home door's lock.  However, I clearly told Mark that I didn't want to see Sophie in this home.  She defamed me, she took everything from me, and I hate her.  Obviously, Mark didn't take my words to heart.  When Sophie saw me, her expression changed. She displayed a pitiful look, ""Lily...""  Tammy immediately hid behind her, as if I were a savage beast. Tammy cried and said, ""Aunt Lily, don't hit my mother!""  I looked coldly at this little girl — who was only ten years old — that looked extremely innocent.  However, it was she who, during Christmas Eve, accused me of beating Sophie at my parents'.  That night was a reunion that I had been looking forward to for several years.  It was also the first time ever since the incident that my parents were willing to let me be home for the holidays.  I tried hard to make my parents love me again, but Sophie pushed me down from the staircase. My leg was injured and no one batted an eye.  Everyone rushed to Sophie's side instead.  They gathered around her to see if she was okay. I cried from the pain and said, ""She pushed me.""  Sophie didn't defend herself, but said bitterly with red eyes, ""Whatever she said.""  Tammy suddenly burst into tears. As she came down the stairs, she asked, ""Auntie, why did you push my mommy? Mommy did not want to come here and disturb your family reunion. It's Granny and Grandad who insisted on inviting us here. If you don't like us here, we can leave. Why did you push Mommy?""  After she said that, my mother rushed up to me and slapped me in the face.  She spoke with disgust in her voice, ""I thought you had sincerely repented in the past few years, but I didn't expect you to be even more vicious than before!""  At that moment, tears flowed out of my eyes like a broken dam.  I insisted with tears in my eyes that I didn’t push Sophie, yet no one believed me.  My dad looked at me with a disappointed face, ""Can a child as young as Tammy know how to lie?""  Mark clenched his fists and said coldly, ""Lily, you really are a lost cause.""  Anthony came over and kicked my broken leg with intention, causing me to cry out in pain.  However, no one cared about my pleas. They felt as if they had finally released their resentment after seeing me wince in pain.  No one said a word, but their faces were clear and said everything — they believed I deserved every bit of this pain.  Anthony said, ""You are a bad mother, I hate you so much.""  …  That day, I limped away from their home in tears. I still remember the heartache from that night.  With that final push, I decided to file for a divorce.  At that time, he just calmly tore apart my divorce papers and said, ""Lily, don't you understand? No one can love you except me now.""  I was stunned and speechless, questioning if he ever even loved me.  He saw through me and mocked, ""If I didn't love you, how could I have tolerated all your evil deeds? Lily, your parents no longer want you. They want to accept Sophie as their adopted daughter. Just stay by my side and atone your sins for Sophie with me, okay?""  That night, my unloved self was convinced by Mark.  I was so scared. I was afraid that no one in this world would love me. I was afraid that if I lost this family, I would be a homeless orphan, drifting like a duckweed in the water.  I didn't want to be a weed that no one liked.  Therefore, I learned to give in and stayed quiet.  I stopped defending myself, and allowed the father and son to ignore me and favor Sophie and her daughter under the pretext of making amends.  However, my submission did not lead to a favorable result after all this time.  It was too painful to look back, and my thoughts were interrupted by Anthony rushing over.  Anthony pushed me away, took Tammy's hand, and comforted her, ""Don't be afraid, Tammy. No one can bully you and Aunt Sophie under Dad and I's watch.""  After saying that, he shot me a warning look, ""If you dare to hurt them, I will never call you my mother ever again.""  Tammy said with a sensible tone, ""Anthony, don't be rude to Auntie Lily...""  She looked at me with a flattering smile, ""Auntie, I know you don't like me and my mommy. We are not like you. We have nothing. Can you please not drive us away?""  As the saying goes, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.   I smiled at her, ""What do you mean you have nothing? This home will be yours from now on.""",https://www.facebook.com/61558228850235/,61558228850235,15 Jan 2025 - 16 Jan 2025 · Total active time 10 hrs,1.4166666666666667,13
